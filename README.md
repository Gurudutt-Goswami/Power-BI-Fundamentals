2) Supports NLP for Q&A for data insights | Tableau is also going to have this in near future
3) Very easy to integrate with microsoft products like excel,csv,azure etc. but not very diverse compared to tableau when it comes to data source connection.
4) Uses DAX Expression & M language for data manipulation & data modelling can also connect with R languages with Microsoft revolution analytics | Connects much better with R comparitively
